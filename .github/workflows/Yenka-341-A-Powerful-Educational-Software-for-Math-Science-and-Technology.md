## How to use Yenka 3.4.1
 
Yenka 3.4.1 is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. You can start by choosing one of the four subjects: Mathematics, Science, Technology or Computing and Communication Technology. Each subject has a different set of tools and components that you can drag and drop onto the workspace. You can also access the online content library, where you can find hundreds of ready-made models and lessons that you can use or modify.
 
Once you have created your model, you can run it and see how it behaves. You can change the parameters, zoom in and out, rotate and pan the view, and measure various quantities. You can also add annotations, labels, graphs and tables to enhance your presentation. You can save your model as a file or export it as a web page.
 
One of the unique features of Yenka 3.4.1 is that you can integrate different subjects in one model. For example, you can use Yenka PICs to add programmable microcontroller chips to your circuit, program them using flowcharts, and export the program to a real chip[^2^]. You can also use Yenka 3D Shapes to create 3D models of objects and link them to your circuit or program[^1^]. This way, you can create realistic and engaging models that demonstrate the connections between different disciplines.
